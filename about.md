## Who I am

![Me]({{ site.url }}/public/images/about/me.png)
My name is Nejc Škofič (or Skofic if keyboard with Slovenian layout is not available).
While in terms on computers and programming I was no wonder child (I wrote my first
non trivial code for faculty course), I've always had affinity for mathematics and
logic. And coupled with love for building useful things, I think that programming
is the best career that I could have chosen :)

## What this blog is about

When working on one thing or another I must frequently find solutions to problems
that are not trivial. Since I don't know everything (yet...), I then have to spent
time researching and tinkering until I am satisfied with result. This blog is
an attempt to document interesting (to me) solutions. And hopefully you may find some
of the posts helpful too.

As for topics, they reflect what I am currently working on. Mostly .NET platform
related, Visual Studio usage and extensions and from time to time database
related stuff.
